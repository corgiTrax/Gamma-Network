# Gamma-Network
For gamma frequency analysis

-[ ] Spike rate recalculate: using 2.1-5.1 seconds window
-[ ] Look at spike before and after stimulus onset
-[ ] Group spikes by their carrying frequency, i.e., only look at spikes that belong to one process 
-[ ] Other frequency ranges: gamma, beta, theta...
-[ ] Poisson statistics vs. our model
-[ ] Frequency coupling?
-[ ] Look at journal reviews, grant revews, etc
-[ ] Final paper
-[ ] Other datasets?
