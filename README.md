# Gamma-Network
For gamma frequency analysis

- [x] Spike rate recalculate: using 2.1-5.1 seconds window
- [ ] Fourier spectrogram of the data -- find most prominent frequency
- [ ] Look at for each cell, each stimulus, whether the same gamma freq. is invoked (even without spike)
- [ ] Look at spike before and after stimulus onset
- [ ] Figure 5 of Jehee paper
- [ ] Figure 8 of Jehee paper
- [ ] Look at carrying frequency of the spikes
- [ ] Group spikes by their carrying frequency, i.e., only look at spikes that belong to one process 
- [ ] Poisson statistics vs. our model
- [ ] Look at journal reviews, grant revews, etc
- [ ] Final paper

- [ ] Other frequency ranges: gamma, beta, theta...
- [ ] Frequency coupling?
- [ ] Other datasets?
